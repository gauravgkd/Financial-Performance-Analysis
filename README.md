💼 **Financial Performance Analysis using SQL & Power BI**


📌 **Project Overview**
This project is focused on analyzing a company's financial performance across different departments using SQL and visualizing the insights through Power BI dashboards. 
The objective is to provide key financial metrics like total profit, budget vs actual comparisons, and department-level profitability for better strategic decision-making.



📊 **Features**
Analysis of key financial KPIs

Interactive Power BI dashboard with dynamic filters

SQL-based data extraction and transformation

Clean and structured financial reporting



📁 **Dataset Description**

Total Profit (Overall): Company’s net profit over all periods and departments.

Average Expense Variance (%): How actual expenses deviate from the budget on average.

Average Revenue Variance (%): Average deviation between budgeted and actual revenue.

Total Budgeted Expense vs. Actual Expense: Measures how planned spending compares to actuals.

Department with Highest Profit: Identifies the top-performing department by profit.

Total Budgeted vs. Actual Revenue: Comparison of projected vs. earned revenue.

Profit Margin (%) by Department: Profitability percentage per department based on revenue.



📈 **Power BI Dashboard Highlights**
KPI Cards: Quick insights into total profit, variances, and department performance.

Bar Charts: Comparative view of expenses and revenue by department.

Filters: Slicers for department and month to allow drilldown and focused analysis.
